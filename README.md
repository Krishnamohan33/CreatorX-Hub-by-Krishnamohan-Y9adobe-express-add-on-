## 🛠 How It Works

The add-on is built and tested using **Adobe Express Developer Mode** with the built-in **Playground environment**.

- Uses standard HTML/CSS/JavaScript  
- Leverages Adobe Express Add-on SDK to:
  - Create sidebar UI
  - Handle file inputs
  - Load/export content into the canvas
- Lightweight, responsive, and modular
