## üõ† How It Works

The add-on is built and tested using **Adobe Express Developer Mode** with the built-in **Playground environment**.

- Uses standard HTML/CSS/JavaScript  
- Leverages Adobe Express Add-on SDK to:
  - Create sidebar UI
  - Handle file inputs
  - Load/export content into the canvas
- Lightweight, responsive, and modular

## üöÄ Getting Started (Developer Mode)

1. Clone this repository
2. Open [Adobe Express Developer Mode](https://developer.adobe.com/express/add-ons/overview/)
3. Select **"Playground"** and paste the `index.html` file content
4. Test sidebar UI interactions and canvas content injection

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This is an early-stage prototype built using Adobe Express Developer Playground. It's not fully functional yet, but with support and collaboration, I'm excited to bring it to production.
